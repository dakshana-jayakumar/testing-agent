# Lumos Development Log 🔮

*AI-Powered Testing Intelligence Platform with SvelteKit + Neurolink*

## 📅 Project Timeline

**Started:** September 16, 2025
**Current Phase:** Initial Setup & Research
**Target:** 5-day SvelteKit implementation

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

### **What is Lumos?**
- **AI Testing Intelligence Platform** that goes beyond debugging
- Uses **Neurolink SDK** for multi-AI provider access (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.)
- Built with **TypeScript + Playwright** as core technologies with Commander.js CLI framework
- Provides **complete testing intelligence**: error analysis, test validation, visual analysis, solution mining

### **Core Capabilities:**
1. **Error Intelligence & Debugging** - AI-powered error classification and fix suggestions
2. **Test Quality Intelligence** - Validates existing test suites and identifies improvements
3. **Visual Analysis** - DOM state capture and screenshot analysis for UI failures
4. **Web Research & Solution Mining** - Stack Overflow, GitHub, documentation integration
5. **Organizational Learning** - Pattern recognition and knowledge accumulation

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### **Technology Stack:**
- **CLI Framework:** Commander.js with TypeScript
- **AI Platform:** Neurolink SDK (multi-provider: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Azure)
- **Browser Automation:** Playwright (for visual analysis)
- **Database:** Better-SQLite3 (for pattern storage and learning)
- **Testing:** Vitest with comprehensive mocking (MSW, nock, memfs)
- **Configuration:** Zod-based schema validation with YAML configs

### **Key Architecture Decisions:**
1. **TypeScript + Playwright Focus** - Core technologies for type safety and browser automation
2. **CLI-First Approach** - Enterprise-grade command-line interface for developer workflows
3. **Comprehensive Mocking Strategy** - Non-intercepting mocks for thorough testing
4. **Unified Context System** - Single context gathering with multi-operation reuse

## 🔍 Research & Discoveries

### **SvelteKit Key Features (from docs):**
- **Full-stack framework** similar to Next.js (React) or Nuxt (Vue)
- **Server-side rendering (SSR)** + client-side capabilities
- **API routes** via `+server.ts` files for backend logic
- **Hot Module Replacement** via Vite for fast development
- **Build optimizations** and modern best practices built-in

### **Neurolink Architecture Understanding:**
- **NOT an LLM** - it's a coordination platform/SDK
- **Multi-provider access** - OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Azure, etc.
- **Automatic fallback** - if one provider fails, try others
- **MCP support** - Model Context Protocol for advanced tool integration
- **Cost optimization** - route to best/cheapest provider for each task
