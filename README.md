## ðŸŽ¯ __Main Objective__

Create an __AI-powered error intelligence & test validation system__ using Juspay's Neurolink SDK - focused on __debugging assistance__ rather than test generation.

## ðŸ“‹ __Core Goals__

- __Reduce debugging time by 60%__ through intelligent error analysis
- __Improve test quality by 85%__ through AI validation
- __Build organizational testing knowledge__ through pattern learning

## ðŸš€ __Phase 1.5 Implementation (5-7 days) - PRIMARY FOCUS__

### __6 Key Components:__

1. __Error Intelligence Engine__

   - Multi-AI error classification
   - Pattern recognition and learning
   - Confidence scoring

2. __Visual Failure Analysis (Puppeteer)__

   - DOM state capture
   - Screenshots and console errors
   - Network monitoring

3. __Test Validation Engine__

   - Quality assessment of existing tests
   - Coverage gap identification
   - Flakiness detection

4. __Web Research & Solution Mining__

   - Stack Overflow + GitHub integration
   - AI-powered solution ranking
   - Community knowledge extraction

5. __Fix Suggestion Engine__

   - Multi-provider AI suggestions
   - Step-by-step implementation guides
   - Risk assessment and verification

6. __CLI Interface & Dashboard__

   - Developer-friendly commands
   - HTML reports with visual evidence
   - Interactive debugging sessions

## ðŸ›  __Technical Architecture__

- __Neurolink SDK__ for multi-AI provider access (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.)
- __TypeScript__ with strict type safety
- __Puppeteer__ for visual analysis
- __SQLite__ for pattern storage
- __Comprehensive testing strategy__ with 85%+ coverage targets

## ðŸ“Š __Success Metrics__

- > 85% fix suggestion accuracy

- > 90% web research relevance

- <30 seconds analysis time

- <15% false positive rate

## ðŸ”„ __Future Phases__

- __Phase 2__: Automated fix application + Git integration
- __Phase 3__: Intelligent test generation based on learned patterns

The plan is a comprehensive blueprint for building a production-ready AI debugging assistant that learns from failures and provides actionable solutions.
